EC2 Drivers Cookbook
====================

This cookbook installs (via DKMS) the latest versions of the drivers needed on EC2: ena and ixgbevf. Currently, this cookbook is only tested on CentOS 8, but patches are welcome for other operating systems. We also only test this cookbook on CINC, so if you have the commercial version of Chef, do let us know if it works :).
